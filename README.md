# Freshers Connect by Lisa Marline Schmidt
Freshers Connect is an application developed for first-year student that helps them to connect with other freshers. It is always challenging to start somewhere new. So it is my goal to make this new start a bit easier by connecting students based on their studies and interests to build a foundation for long lastig friendships.
